# Introduction

Web Sites security is a major concern these days, even though many security controls are applied, still there will be always new types of attacks.

Traditional security controls depends on predefined attack signatures which been inspected in limited time window.

In this project, we are going to investigate the logs of three security controls applied on one website in order to reveal attacks that are not detected by the current controls. 


# Content

Each row of the logs in the three data sets corresponds to one http request, and each row has its own time stamp.

# Methodology

In our project, we will investigate the relationship between the source Addressand the hit count in order to distinguish the legitimate requests and isolate other requests for further analyses

# Data set remarks
the git repo contains data.zip which contains two files
1. projectdata.csv : which is the whole logs for Feb 2017
2. pdata.csv  : is a small sample from the above used to facilitate calcuations and simplfy visualization
